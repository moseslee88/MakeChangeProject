## Moses' Make Change Project
This is my week 1 homework Project

I am learning how to utilize Java expressions.

(Note to self: Fill out this README.markdown file as a blog, talking through what i do for MakeChange.)

The modulo operator is awesome!

Basically, in this MakeChange Project, I utilized a method outside of a class to Validate whether or not the user followed the prompt, and if the amount tendered doesn't make sense, I prompted the user again until conditions (moneyparse is greater than priceparse) were finally met. I will go over this method.

First, I prompted the user to enter the price of item and then the amount tendered by customer. After all this initial info was entered, I called upon the Method, which I appropriately labelled "checkRightPrice." In this method, I basically did two things: validate whether or not the user's prompted numbers meet the conditions and/or make sense and Calculate the amount of change that is due back to customer, based on largest bill and coin denomination possible.
